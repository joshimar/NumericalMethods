# NumericalMethods
Java examples of Numerical Methods to calculate the root of a function. 

The available examples are:

1. Newton Raphson
2. Bisection (Binary Search)
3. Fixed Point
4. False Rule

To run the examples, you must specify the algorithm and its corresponding input values in a properties file including the equation.
The only types of equations supported are polynomials of the form C0 + C1x + C2x^2 ... with integer exponents.
